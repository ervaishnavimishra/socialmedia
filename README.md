# Overview
I built this tool to help analyze social media content performance using DataStax Astra DB and Langflow. It's a project for the Level Supermind Hackathon that looks at how different types of posts (photos, videos, reels,etc.) perform and gives you useful insights about what works best.

# What This Tool Does
- **Analyzes** how well your posts are doing in real-time  
- **Uses GPT** to give you content suggestions  
- **Helps** find similar content  
- **Predicts** how new content might perform  

# How It Works
### The Main Parts:
#### **DataStax Astra DB**
- Stores and organizes all your post data  
- Makes it easy to find similar content  
- Handles lots of data smoothly  

#### **Langflow**
- Connects everything together  
- Processes data automatically  
- Works with GPT to give you insights

## Getting Started With The Project : 
This project is easy to replicate using the provided sample data:

### Get the Data
- Check the dataset.csv file for the sample dataset 
- Contains 25 social media posts with likes, comments, shares, etc.
- Real-world engagement patterns included
- Upload this data in your astra db
### Set Up the Flow
